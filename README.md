The aim of the project was to improve the early diagnosis and detection of cardiovascular diseases through the use of AI, focusing on the prediction of the
likelihood of either developing cardiovascular events (such as strokes) or being
at high cardiovascular risk in the future, in a cohort of mostly healthy subjects.
The data set analyzed was generated by the longitudinal PLIC
study (University of Milano, Italy), which focused on the metabolic syndrome
(MetS) and on the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery as a
subclinical marker of cardiovascular disease. The PLIC study followed-up 1445
patients who completed four visits over a period of 16 years. The data set that
was made available by UniMI for this work includes and ultrasound images
of the carotid arteries to measure the mean IMT and to detect the potential
presence of atheromatous lesions (plaques).

 On this ultrasound imaging
data, we applied deep learning (DL) techniques, implementing a neural network
to predict the presence of plaque in the future from the ultrasound imaging of
visit 1.
